# ViroScreenshotDemo

This project was created to show other developers how to use Viro React and React Native to create an AR mobile app that features screenshot functionality (for iOS). I decided to create this source code after developing go.bARK and running into road blocks when using Viro React. I also couldn't find any information about how to write code that takes a screenshot and saves it to the user's photos on their phone. I hope this tutorial helps you create something amazing :rainbow:
