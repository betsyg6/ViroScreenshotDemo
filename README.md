# ViroScreenshotDemo

This project was created to show other developers how to use Viro React and React Native to create an AR mobile app that features screenshot functionality (for iOS). I decided to create this source code after developing [go.bARK](https://github.com/gh-capstone-team-c/Go.bARk) and running into road blocks when using Viro React. I also couldn't find any information about how to write code that takes a screenshot and saves it to the user's photos on their phone. I hope this tutorial helps you create something amazing :rainbow:

This repo is mostly [Viro React's sample code](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/quick-start). I wrote my code in js>HelloWorldAR.js and App.js, and I added the res folder inside of js (this folder contains 3-d assets that can be rendered in the AR scene). 

To run the code:
 ```
 cd <directory you want to download to>
 
 git clone https://github.com/betsyg6/ViroScreenshotDemo.git
 
 npm install

 on a mobile app/tablet, download ViroMedia app

 npm start

 in ViroMedia app: menu >> testbed >> enter ngrok link from terminal or IP address
 
 take screenshots!
 ```
